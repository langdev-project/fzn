## description ##

FIZONAL SECOND-IN-DEVELOPMENT is an as-yet unnamed language in the FIZONAL family.
Unlike its sibling language FIZENG, it uses HAN CHARACTERS with their original meanings as an ideographic writing system.
This allows for a much more localized and diverse phonological system which is not tied to orthography at all.

FIZONAL SECOND-IN-DEVELOPMENT will utilize the temporary language code `art-x-fzn-x-2dev` until it is given a more proper name.
