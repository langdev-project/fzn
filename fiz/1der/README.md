# 斤丸舌 : FIRST DERIVATIVE #

The first level of evolution and abstraction from PROTO-FIZONAL; characters for writing are introduced here.
The first derivative helps to normalize the phonology of THE LANGUAGE and give it a unique character.
The following general shifts and changes are recorded:

## Phonological changes: ##

1.  When a long vowel ends a word, it is palatalized (<i>a:</i> > <i>aw</i>, <i>e:</i> > <i>ew</i>, <i>i</i> > <i>ij</i> <i>o:</i> > <i>ow</i>, <i>u:</i> > <i>uw</i>)

2.  When a long vowel is followed by a consonant in a word-final syllable, an <i>e</i> is added to the end (<i>bau:zh</i> > <i>báu:zhe</i>)

3.  When a long vowel is followed by stop onset, the length of the stop is doubled and the vowel is shortened (<i>arbí:tu</i> > <i>arbíttu</i>)

4.  Other long diphthongs are palatalized (<i>au:</i> > <i>a:w</i>, <i>ai:</i> > <i>a:j</i>, <i>ua:</i> > <i>wa:</i>, <i>oi:</i> > <i>o:j</i>); short diphthongs are separated

5.  When a syllable coda contains a <i>w</i> or <i>j</i> followed by another consonant, the second consonant is moved into the onset of a new syllable with nucleus <i>e</i>

6.  <i>j</i> becomes <i>je</i> when followed by a nasal

7.  All double and word-final consonants are devoiced

8.  The following changes occur to word-final consonants:

    * <i>q</i> is dropped when not followed by <i>g</i>
    * {<i>qg</i>, <i>n</i>} becomes <i>q</i>

9.  <i>r</i> is dropped when preceded by (palato-)alveolar consonants

10. <i>i</i> and <i>u</i> become <i>y</i> and <i>w</i> when followed by another vowel

11. <i>zh</i> becomes <i>z</i> (<i>/ʑ/</i>) and <i>sh</i> becomes <i>s</i> (<i>/ɕ/</i>)

12. Several chain shifts occur:

    * <i>gj</i> > <i>g</i> > <i>k</i> > <i>h</i>
    * <i>n</i> > <i>d</i> > <i>r</i> > <i>t</i>
    * <i>m</i> > <i>b</i> > <i>p</i> > <i>f</i>

    Note that these shifts do not occur when the consonant is word-final.

13. A few more shifts occur:

    1. Onsets <i>g</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>b</i> become <i>q</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>m</i> when preceded by an stressed syllable
    2. Onsets <i>k</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>p</i> become <i>g</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>b</i> when preceded by an unstressed syllable
    3. Codas <i>k</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>p</i> become <i>g</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>b</i> when preceded by a complex (long or diphthong) nucleus

14. The following codas are split off into new syllables with the given nuclei:

    * {<i>g</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>h</i>} : <i>a</i>
    * {<i>d</i>, <i>t</i>} : <i>i</i>
    * {<i>b</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>f</i>} : <i>e</i>
    * {<i>l</i>, <i>r</i>} : <i>u</i>
    * {<i>j</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>m</i>} : <i>o</i>

    (Codas which end verbs may be treated differently)

15. <i>l</i> becomes <i>n</i>

16. Unaccented <i>e</i> becomes <i>a</i>; accented <i>e</i> becomes <i>/e/</i>

17. <i>yi</i> and <i>wu</i> are simplified to <i>i</i> and <i>u</i>.

## Changes in syntax: ##

Modal particles are shifted to the ends of words and some affixes detach, forming proper verbal conjugations.
Many irregular forms exist, grandfathered in from PROTO-FIZONAL.

Some verbs are grammaticalized into dual-function postposition-adverbs, while some nouns are grammaticalized into classifiers.
Noun phrases now consist of the following:

1. Zero or more determiners
2. Zero or one classifiers
3. Zero or more relative clauses and postpositional phrases
4. Exactly one noun
5. Exactly one noun-case post-position

This word-order is now fairly strict.
With the addition of adverbs, general sentence word-order is now as follows:

1. Zero or more noun prhases
2. One or two verbs
3. Zero or more adverbs

Noun phrases must come before verbs, but adverbs may exist anywhere outside of a noun phrase.

## Orthography: ##

A character-based system of writing (<i lang="qdi">honzi</i>) is introduced, using japanese kanji as it's source. Characters are chosen for either their symbolic meaning or their on'yomi reading.
