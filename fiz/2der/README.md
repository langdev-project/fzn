# 斤丸舌 : SECOND DERIVATIVE

The second level of evolution and abstraction from the initial PROTO-LANGUAGE.
The second derivative helps to simplify THE PROTO-LANGUAGE and make it easier to write.

## Phonological changes: ##

Syllable stress is shifted to the first syllable of all roots. In addition, there are *many* consonant merges:

*   <b><i>f</i>~<i>h</i> :</b>

    The following syllables are produced: <i>ha</i>, <i>he</i>, <i>fi</i>, <i>ho</i>, <i>fu</i>.

*   <b><i>s</i>~<i>z</i> :</b>

    In the onsets of stressed syllables, <i>z</i>; in codas, <i>s</i>. In the onsets of unstressed syllables, <i>z</i> when following <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, or <i>s</i>/<i>z</i>; <i>s</i> otherwise.

*   <b><i>d</i>~<i>r</i> :</b>

    Pronounced <i>r</i> following any vowel; pronounced <i>d</i> otherwise.

*   <b><i>n</i>~<i>q</i> :</b>

    The resulting nasal is pronounced as <i>q</i> when the preceeding consonant (if present, often in a preceeding syllable) is one of the following: <i>g</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>h</i> (but __not__ <i>f</i>), <i>s</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>w</i>; pronounced <i>n</i> otherwise.

## Word simplifications: ##

The number of syllables in many words is reduced, following a few patterns:

*   When the first mora of a word is a voiceless stop and the second mora is a voiced stop, the first is often dropped

## Changes in syntax: ##

The number of irregular verbs is reduced, and the conjugation-system is simplified and perfected. Classifiers are consolidated and become a closed grammatical class.

## Orthography: ##

The character-based system of writing of D1 is consolidated into a syllabary. Some characters are reserved for use in grammatical words, to make reading easier, although these may be grandfathered in with some lexical words.
