# PROTO-FIZONAL #

PROTO-FIZONAL serves to provide the core roots, grammars, and systems for development of the FIZONAL family of languages.
It may be effectively utilized as a core for the development of sibling languages or for educational purposes.
This document serves as a reference for various aspects of PROTO-FIZONAL and its development.

Because it defines a proto-language, this document should be considered speculative, third-hand, and for reference purposes only.

### accent

PROTO-FIZONAL features a simple pitch-accent system in which the root of a word is always spoken at a higher pitch than any affixes.
Accents, if marked, are transcribed via an acute accent over the vowel of the syllable; in the case of diphthongs, accents are placed over the <i>a</i> or (in the case of <i>oi</i>) the <i>i</i>.
Accents are usually not marked for monosyllabic words.

### word-order

The general word-order for sentences in PROTO-FIZONAL is as follows:

1. Zero or more noun phrases
2. Zero or one modal particle
3. One or two verbs

This word-order is very flexible.
In particluar, words might be rearranged to place emphasis on certain parts of the sentence.

### noun phrases

1. Zero or more determiners
2. Zero or more relative clauses
3. One (or occasionally more) noun(s)

There are three noun-cases in PROTO-FIZONAL: topical, nominative, and objective.
Noun phrases in the topical case are placed at the beginning of the sentence.
If a nominative phrase is provided but an objective phrase is absent, the topical case may function like the objective.
If no nominative phrase is provided, it may function like the nominative.

### modality

Several modalities can be expressed in THE PROTO-LANGUAGE.
The default is the indicative, but any of the following can be expressed via the addition of a particle before the main verb:

* the mirative modality marks a statement as surprising or unexpected to the speaker
* the optative modality marks a statement as expressing a future wish, present desire, or past regret
* the hortative modality marks a statement as making a request or suggestion, or as saying what should be
* the permissive modality marks a statement as giving permission to do something ("you may…", etc.)

* the interrogative modality marks a statement as a question

### verbs

Verbs in PROTO-FIZONAL are classified as perfective, continuous, or progressive.
Perfective verbs describe actions or relations over the entirety of their duration; continuous verbs describe a continuous state with no clear beginning or end and habitual actions; progressive verbs describe actions or relations which {are, were, will be} ongoing, but which progress from a beginning towards an end.
The distinction between these categories is entirely lexical—there are no grammatical mechanisms for verbal conjugation.
